  Title: Ammo Supply
  Description: When your ammo is running low and the zombie horde is closing in,
    fire off your flare gun and signal the skies for reinforcements. In no time,
    you'll receive a crate packed with max ammo for both your weapons, as well as
    three of your equipped grenades. Crack it open and gear up with enough firepower
    to make those zombies regret ever messing with you!
