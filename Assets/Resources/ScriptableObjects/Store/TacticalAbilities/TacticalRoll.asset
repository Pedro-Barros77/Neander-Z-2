  Title: Tactical Roll
  Description: When the undead are closing in and you need to dodge your way out,
    there's no better move than the Tactical Roll. It allows you to dive to the left
    or right, evading enemy attacks like a pro. <br><br>Just remember, there's a
    bit of a cooldown to prevent you from becoming a perpetual rolling machine, and
    it will drain your stamina, so use it wisely.
